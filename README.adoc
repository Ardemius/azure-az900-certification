=== Discuss why cloud services

.Cloud Computing
----
Cloud Computing  is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
----

Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, including:

    * *Compute power* - such as Linux servers or web applications.
    * *Storage* - such as files and databases.
    * *Networking* - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company.
    * *Analytics* - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.

.Computing choices for Cloud: VMs, containers or serverless

Key Cloud Concepts :

    * *High availability*. The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question.

    * *Scalability*. The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as scaling out), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as scaling up). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.

    * *Elasticity*. The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it’s needed (and from the most advantageous geographic location). A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.

    * *Agility*. The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services. +
    Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure to adapt to the evolving needs of the business.

    * *Fault tolerance*. The ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.

    * *Disaster recovery*. The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily available to use.

    * *Global reach*. The ability to reach audiences around the globe. Cloud services can have a presence in various regions across the globe, which you and your customer can access, giving you a presence in those regions even though you may not have any infrastructure in that region.

    * *Customer latency capabilities*. If customers are experiencing slowness with a particular cloud service, they are said to be experiencing some latency. Even though modern fiber optics are fast, it can still take time for services to react to customer actions if the service is not local to the customer. Cloud services have the ability to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any customer latency issues.

    * *Predictive cost considerations*. The ability for users to predict the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service. Costs for individual services are made available, and tools are provided to allow you to predict the costs a service will incur. You can also perform analysis based on planned growth.

    * *Technical skill requirements and considerations*. Cloud services can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical infrastructure for handling the same workload. A user can be an expert in the application they want to run without requiring skills to build and maintain the underlying hardware and software infrastructure.

    * *Increased productivity*. On-site datacenters typically require a lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking), software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing eliminates the need for many of these tasks. This allows IT teams to spend time focusing on achieving more important business goals.

    * *Security*. Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. The result is strengthened security, which helps to protect data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

=== Distinguish types of cloud models

3 different cloud deployment models: *Public Cloud*, *Private Cloud*, and *Hybrid Cloud*.

An example of a *hybrid cloud* usage scenario would be hosting a website in the public cloud and *linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud*. +
Hybrid cloud scenarios can be useful when organizations have some things that cannot be put in a public cloud, possibly for legal reasons. For example, you may have medical data that cannot be exposed publicly. +
Another example is one or more applications that run on old hardware that can’t be updated. In this case, you can keep the old system running locally in your private cloud and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage.

* *Private cloud* can be hosted on premise, *OR* managed by a Cloud provider.
    ** le fait qu'un private Cloud puisse être hébergé chez un Cloud provider est expliqué dans la vidéo, mais les explications texte qui suivent semblent dire le contraire... (?)
        *** je confirme que la vidéo dit bien "on premise OR managed by a Cloud provider"

Remember, the *cloud deployment model* you choose will depend on your *budget*, *security*, *scalability*, and *maintenance needs*. Azure provides all of the flexibility and capabilities to meet your specific needs.

=== Explore types of cloud services

.Shared responsibility model
____
The *shared responsibility model* ensures *cloud workloads* are *run securely* and in a well-managed way. Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider is responsible for some aspects of the workload management, and the customer or end user is responsible for other aspects of the workload management, and in some cases, both share a responsibility.
____

.IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
image::azure-az900_03.png[]

Common examples of SaaS apps and software: email, calendars, office tools (such as Office 365)

[quote, 'https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/learn/modules/explore-types-cloud-services/6-compare-cloud-services']
____
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS each contain different levels of managed services. You may easily use a combination of these types of infrastructure. You could use Microsoft 365 on your company’s computers (*SaaS*), and in Azure you could host your VMs (*IaaS*) and use Azure SQL Database (*PaaS*) to store your data. With the cloud’s flexibility, you can use any combination that provides you with the maximum result.

== Distinguish Microsoft Azure Core Services (AZ-900)

=== Discuss core Azure architectural components

In this module, you will:

* Explore the physical structure of Azure infrastructure
* Understand the service level agreements provided by Azure
* Learn how to provide your own service level agreements for your apps

*2 Data Centers en France* pour Azure, Paris et Marseille (correspond à 2 "regions", France Central and France South) +
https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/global-infrastructure/geographies/

A few examples of *regions* are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the time of writing this, Azure is generally available in *60 regions* and available in *140 countries*.

image::azure-az900_04.svg[]

Cf site de Microsoft, _"Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider"_

Pour info, voici https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?regions=france-south,france-central,europe-north,europe-west&products=all[le lien vers la liste des produits Azure disponibles pour les régions North Europe (Dublin), West Europe (Amsterdam), France Central (Paris), France South (Marseille)].

Each *Azure region* is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a *region pair*.

image::azure-az900_05.png[]

Azure divides the world into *geographies* that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market typically *containing two or more regions* that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

.Data residency
[IMPORTANT]
====
Data residency refers to the physical or geographic location of an organization's data or information. *It defines the legal or regulatory requirements imposed on data* based on the country or region in which it resides and is an important consideration when planning out your application data storage.
====

.Availability Options
image::azure-az900_06.png[]

.Availability Sets
image::azure-az900_07.png[]

Availability sets are made up of *Update domains* (UD) and *Fault domains* (FD):

    * *Update domains*. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains. Sequencing updates using update domains ensures that the entire datacenter isn't unavailable during platform updates and patching. Update domains are a logical section of the datacenter, and *they are implemented with software and logic*.

    * *Fault domains*. Fault domains *provide for the physical separation of your workload* across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

== Lexique

[glossary]
IOPS:: I/O operations per second
CapEx:: Capital Expenditure. This is the up front spending of money on physical infrastructure, and then deducting that up front expense over time. The up front cost from CapEx has a value that reduces over time.
OpEx:: This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense in the same year you spend it. There is no up front cost, as you pay for a service or product as you use it.
Hosting provider:: un synonyme pour "cloud services provider"
