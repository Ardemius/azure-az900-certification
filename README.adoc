=== Introduction to Azure fundamentals

==== What is cloud computing ?

*Cloud computing*: The delivery of computing services over the internet, which is otherwise known as the cloud. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.

Cloud computing is a way to rent *compute power* and *storage* from someone else's datacenter.

Cloud computing *advantages*:

    * *High availability*: Depending on the service-level agreement (SLA) that you choose, your cloud-based applications can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime even when things go wrong.

    * *Scalability*: Applications in the cloud can be scaled in two ways:
        ** *Vertically*: Computing capacity can be increased by adding RAM or CPUs to a virtual machine.
        ** *Horizontally*: Computing capacity can be increased by adding instances of a resource, such as adding more virtual machines to your configuration.

    * *Elasticity*: Cloud-based applications can be configured to take advantage of autoscaling, so your applications will always have the resources they need.

    * *Agility*: Cloud-based resources can be deployed and configured quickly as your application requirements change.

    * *Geo-distribution*: Applications and data can be deployed to regional datacenters around the globe, so your customers always have the best performance in their region.

    * *Disaster recovery*: By taking advantage of cloud-based backup services, data replication, and geo-distribution, you can deploy your applications with the confidence that comes from knowing that your data is safe in the event that disaster should occur.

Cloud *service models*: *IaaS* / *PaaS* / *SaaS*

.levels of responsibility betweee a cloud provider and a cloud tenant
image::azure-az900_10.png[]

*Serverless computing*: With serverless applications, the cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and *event-driven*. They use resources only when a specific function or trigger occurs.

.public, private and hybrid clouds
image:azure-az900_11.png[]

* *public cloud*: Services are offered over the public internet and available to anyone who wants to purchase them. Cloud resources like servers and storage are owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider and delivered over the internet.
* *private cloud*: Computing resources are *used exclusively by users from one business* or organization. A private cloud can be physically located at your organization's on-site datacenter. *It also can be hosted by a third-party service provider*.
* *hybrid cloud*: This computing environment combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

==== What is Azure ?

.How does Azure work?
image::azure-az900_12.png[]

*Azure portal*: a web-based, unified console that provides an alternative to command-line tools.

.Azure services
image::azure-az900_13.png[]

Most commonly used categories:

    * *Compute Services*: including micro-services
    * *Networking features*
    * *Storage*
        ** *Azure Blob storage*: Storage service for very large objects, such as *video files* or *bitmaps*
        ** *Azure File storage*: *File shares* that can be accessed and managed like a file server
        ** *Azure Queue storage*: A data store for *queuing* and reliably *delivering messages* between applications
        ** *Azure Table storage*: A NoSQL store that hosts *unstructured data* independent of any schema
    * *Mobile*
    * *Databases* 
    * *Web*
    * *Internet of Things*
    * *Big Data*
    * *Artificial Intelligence*
        ** includes *cognitive services*, such as *vision*, *speech*, *knowledge mapping*, *Bing search*, *Natural Language Processing*.
    * *DevOps*

    * *App hosting*: to run your entire web application on a managed platform in Windows or Linux
    * *Integration*: logic apps and service bus
    * *Security*

=== Discuss Azure fundamental concepts

* Cloud service providers operate on a *consumption-based model*, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use.
* Cloud services are categorized *OpEx* (Operational Expenditure) and not CapEx (Capital Expenditure), OpEx being a consumption-based model.

____
*IaaS*, *PaaS*, and *SaaS* each contain different levels of managed services. You may easily use a combination of these types of infrastructure. You could use Microsoft 365 on your company’s computers (*SaaS*), and in Azure you could host your VMs (*IaaS*) and use Azure SQL Database (*PaaS*) to store your data. With the cloud’s flexibility, you can use any combination that provides you with the maximum result.

=== Describe core Azure architectural components

The *organizing structure for resources* in Azure has 4 levels: *management groups*, *subscriptions*, *resource groups* and *resources*.

image::azure-az900_14.png[]

==== Azure subscription

    * A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. It also allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription is a *logical unit of Azure services* that links to an *Azure account*, which is an *identity in Azure Active Directory* (Azure AD) or in a directory that Azure AD trusts.
    * An account can have *one subscription or multiple subscriptions* that have different billing models and to which you apply different access-management policies.
    * Azure applies *access-management policies* at the subscription level.
    * A subscription is a set of Azure services bundled together for tracking and billing purposes.

.Billing customization
image::azure-az900_15.png[]

==== Azure Management groups

    * Level of scope above subscriptions. 
    * All subscriptions within a management group automatically inherit the conditions applied to the management group.
    * All subscriptions within a single management group must trust the same Azure AD tenant.

image::azure-az900_16.png[]

Important facts about management groups:

    * *10 000 management groups* can be supported in a single directory.
    * A management group tree can support up to *6 levels of depth*. This limit doesn't include the root level or the subscription level.
    * Each management group and subscription can support *only one parent*.
    * Each management group can have *many children*.
    * All subscriptions and management groups are within *a single hierarchy in each directory*.

==== Resource

A manageable item that's available through Azure. Virtual machines (VMs), storage accounts, web apps, databases, and virtual networks are examples of resources.

==== Resource group

    * A resource group is a *logical container* for resources deployed on Azure.
    * All resources must be in a resource group, and a resource can only be a member of a single resource group.
    * Resource groups *can't be nested*.
    * If you delete a resource group, *all resources contained within it are also deleted*.
    * Resource groups are also a scope for applying *role-based access control* (*RBAC*) permissions.

==== Azure Resource Manager

    * Azure Resource Manager is the *deployment and management service for Azure*. It provides a management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account.

.When a user sends a request from any of the Azure tools, APIs, or SDKs, Resource Manager receives the request.
image::azure-az900_17.png[]

As benefits, it allows you to:

    * Manage your infrastructure through *declarative templates rather than scripts*. A *Resource Manager template* is a *JSON file* that defines what you want to deploy to Azure.
    * Apply access control to all services because role-based access control (RBAC) is natively integrated into the management platform.
    * Clarify your organization's billing by *viewing costs for a group of resources that share the same tag*.

==== Azure regions

Resources are created in *regions*, which are different geographical locations around the globe that contain Azure datacenters. +
A region is a *geographical area* on the planet that contains *at least one but potentially multiple datacenters* that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network.

*2 Data Centers en France* pour Azure, Paris et Marseille (correspond à 2 "regions", France Central and France South) +
https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/global-infrastructure/geographies/

A few examples of *regions* are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the time of writing this, Azure is generally available in *60 regions* and available in *140 countries*.

image::azure-az900_04.svg[]

Cf site de Microsoft, _"Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider"_

==== Azure availability zones

Availability zones are *physically separate datacenters within an Azure region*. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. +
An availability zone is set up to be an *isolation boundary*. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.

    * Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, there’s *a minimum of three separate zones* in all enabled regions.
    * Availability Zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.

image::azure-az900_18.png[]

==== Azure region pairs

It's possible that a large disaster could cause an outage big enough to affect even two datacenters. That's why Azure also creates *region pairs*.

.Azure geographies
[NOTE]
====
Azure divides the world into *geographies* that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market typically *containing two or more regions* that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.
====

* Each Azure region is *always paired with another region* within the *same geography* (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away.
* Data continues to reside within the same geography as its pair (except for Brazil South) for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.

image::azure-az900_19.png[]

== Azure Fundamentals part 2: Describe core Azure services

=== Explore Azure database and analytics services

==== Explore Azure Cosmos DB

Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, *multi-model database* service. +
You can elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure regions worldwide. +
You can take advantage of fast, single-digit-millisecond *data access by using any one of several popular APIs*. +
Azure Cosmos DB provides comprehensive service level agreements for throughput, latency, availability, and consistency guarantees.

Azure Cosmos DB is flexible. At the lowest level, Azure Cosmos DB *stores data in atom-record-sequence (ARS) format*. +
*The data is then abstracted and projected as an API*, which you specify when you're creating your database. +
Your choices include SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Tables, and Gremlin. +
This level of flexibility means that as you migrate your company's databases to Azure Cosmos DB, your developers can stick with the API that they're the most comfortable with.

.atom-record-sequence (ARS) format
[NOTE]
====
As explained in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48223881/how-atom-record-sequence-ars-helps-cosmosdb-to-be-multimodel:

    * You can write data in SQL API and read it in Gremlin API as a graph. If it wasn't for ARS, it would not be possible. +
    The goal of Cosmos DB is *to have all its APIs fully inter-operable* like this and *ARS is the foundational piece to make it happen*.
    * This solution seems to work when you throw *enough hardware* at it.

Have also a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44304947/what-does-it-mean-that-azure-cosmos-db-is-multi-model :

--
*Atoms* consist of a small set of primitive types like string, bool, and number. *Records* are structs composed of these types. *Sequences* are arrays consisting of atoms, records, or sequences. +
The database engine can efficiently translate and project different data models onto the ARS-based data model. +
The core data model of Cosmos DB is natively accessible from dynamically typed programming languages and can be exposed as-is as JSON.
--
====

==== Explore Azure SQL Database

* Azure SQL Database is a relational database based on the latest stable version of the Microsoft SQL Server database engine.
* It is a *platform as a service* (PaaS) database engine.
* It provides 99,99% availability
* Microsoft explains that the newest capabilities of SQL Server are released first to SQL Database, and then to SQL Server itself.
* You can migrate your existing SQL Server databases with minimal downtime by using the *Azure Database Migration Service*.

==== Explore Azure SQL Managed Instance

* Like Azure SQL Database, *Azure SQL Managed Instance* is a *platform as a service* (PaaS) database engine
* 99.99% uptime service level agreement (SLA)
* Azure SQL Managed Instance makes it easy to migrate your on-premises data on SQL Server to the cloud using the *Azure Database Migration Service* (DMS) or *native backup and restore*.

Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance offer many of the same features; however, Azure SQL Managed Instance provides several options that might not be available to Azure SQL Database. +
For a detailed list of the differences between Azure SQL Database and Azure SQL Managed Instance, check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/features-comparison.

Here are some examples of differences:

    * *Change Data Capture* is only possible with Azure SQL Managed Instance
    * Azure SQL Database only uses the default "SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" server collation, it would not be possible to use Cyrillic characters for *collation* for example.

.Change Data Capture
NOTE: For some complete details about *Change Data Capture*, check https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/track-changes/about-change-data-capture-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver15[SQL Server description of this behavior]

==== Explore Azure database for MySQL

* Azure Database for MySQL is a relational database service in the cloud
* Based on the *MySQL Community Edition* database engine, versions *5.6*, *5.7*, and *8.0*
* You have a 99.99 percent availability service level agreement from Azure
* You can use *point-in-time restore* to recover a server to an earlier state, as far *back as 35 days*
* You can migrate your existing MySQL databases with minimal downtime by using the *Azure Database Migration Service*

image::azure-az900_20.png[]

==== Explore Azure database for PostgreSQL

* Azure Database for PostgreSQL is a relational database service in the cloud.
* Based on the *community version* of the open-source PostgreSQL database engine.
* Adjustable *automatic backups* and *point-in-time-restore* for up to *35 days*.
* Enterprise-grade *security* and compliance to protect sensitive data *at-rest* and *in-motion*. This security covers *data encryption on disk* and *SSL encryption between client and server communication*.
* Azure Database for PostgreSQL is available in two deployment options: *Single Server* and *Hyperscale (Citus)*.

*Single Server deployment*:

    * Built-in high availability with no additional cost (99.99% SLA).
    * Ability to protect sensitive data at-rest and in-motion.
    * Automatic backups and point-in-time-restore for up to 35 days.

*Hyperscale (Citus)*:

--
The Hyperscale (Citus) option *horizontally scales* queries across multiple machines by using *sharding*. Its query engine parallelizes incoming SQL queries across these servers for faster responses on large datasets. It serves applications that require greater scale and performance, generally workloads that are approaching, or already exceed, *100 GB of data*.

The Hyperscale (Citus) deployment option supports *multi-tenant applications*, *real-time operational analytics*, and *high throughput transactional workloads*. Applications built for PostgreSQL can run distributed queries on Hyperscale (Citus) with standard connection libraries and minimal changes.
--

==== Explore big data and analytics

Microsoft Azure supports a broad range of technologies and services to provide big data and analytic solutions, including:

    * *Azure Synapse Analytics* (formerly Azure SQL Data Warehouse)
        ** brings together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics
        ** unified experience to ingest, prepare, manage, and serve data for immediate BI and machine learning needs.
        ** a good, logical, choice for analyzing large volumes of data

    * *Azure HDInsight* ("Hadoop and Distributed Insight")
        ** fully managed, open-source analytics service for enterprises
        ** You can run popular open-source frameworks and create cluster types such as *Apache Spark*, *Apache Hadoop*, *Apache Kafka*, *Apache HBase*, *Apache Storm*, and *Machine Learning Services*.
        ** supports a broad range of scenarios such as *extraction*, *transformation*, and *loading* (ETL), *data warehousing*, *machine learning*, and *IoT*.

    * *Azure Databricks*
        ** set up your *Apache Spark* environment in minutes, and then autoscale and collaborate on shared projects in an interactive workspace.
        ** supports *Python*, *Scala*, *R*, *Java*, and *SQL*, as well as data science frameworks and libraries including *TensorFlow*, *PyTorch*, and *scikit-learn*.

    * *Azure Data Lake Analytics*
        ** on-demand analytics job service that simplifies big data.
        ** Instead of deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights.
        ** You only pay for your job when it's running, making it more cost-effective.

=== Explore Azure compute services

Azure computing solutions works on the underlying services:

    * *Virtual machines* : +
        Virtual Machines provides *infrastructure as a service (IaaS)* and can be used in different ways. When you need total control over an operating system and environment, VMs are an ideal choice.
    * *Virtual machine scale sets* : +
        Virtual machine scale sets are an Azure compute resource that you can use to *deploy and manage* a set of *identical VMs*. With all VMs configured the same, virtual machine scale sets are designed to support true autoscale. No pre-provisioning of VMs is required. For this reason, it's easier to build large-scale services targeting big compute, big data, and containerized workloads. As demand goes up, more VM instances can be added. As demand goes down, VM instances can be removed. The process can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.
    * *Containers and Kubernetes*
    * *App Service* : +
        App Service is a *platform as a service (PaaS)* offering.
    * *Functions* (or serverless computing) : +
        Functions  are ideal when you're *concerned only about the code running your service* and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. They're commonly used when you need to perform *work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service*, and when that work *can be completed quickly*, within seconds or less.

==== When to use Azure Virtual Machines

* *Azure Batch* enables large-scale parallel and high-performance computing (HPC) *batch jobs* with the ability to *scale to tens, hundreds, or thousands of VMs*. +
When you-re ready to run a job, Batch does the following:
    ** starts a pool of compute VMs for you
    ** installs applications and staging data
    ** runs jobs with as many tasks as you have
    ** identifies failures
    ** requeues work
    ** scales down the pool as work completes

==== When to use Azure Container Instances or Azure Kubernetes Service

While virtual machines are an excellent way to reduce costs versus the investments that are necessary for physical hardware, they're still limited to a single operating system per virtual machine. If you want to *run multiple instances of an application on a single host machine*, containers are an excellent choice.

    * it reminds us of a downside of VMs: 1 VM can only run 1 OS at a time
        ** If you have multiple server apps require different runtime environments, they may also require multiple VMs to execute properly
    * Also, "short" tasks (like starting an App) are pretty slow with VMs, because creating and starting VMs is slow, as it requires to emulate a full computer

.Difference between VMs and Containers
IMPORTANT: VMs virtualize the hardware, while Containers virtualize the OS

As a conclusion, you choose a *VM* if you need high flexibility, *complete control on the environment*. +
-> *In all other cases, Containers* should be preferred.

There are two ways to manage both *Docker* and *Microsoft-based containers* in Azure: *Azure Container Instances* and *Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)*.

A very good, short video to present *Kubernetes*: https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE2yEuX

.Reminder
NOTE: A microservice can be scaled independently of others.

A *microservice architecture* is more appropriate when:

    * you have a large application that requires *high release velocity*
    * you have complex application that needs to be *highly scalable*
    * you have applications with *rich domains or many subdomains*
    * you have an *organisation that consists in small development teams*

==== When to use Azure App Service

App Service enables you to *build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile back-ends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure*. +
It offers automatic scaling and high availability. App Service supports Windows and Linux and enables automated deployments from GitHub, Azure DevOps, or any Git repo to support a continuous deployment model. +
This *platform as a service (PaaS)* environment allows you to focus on the website and API logic while Azure handles the infrastructure to run and scale your web applications.

*API apps*: Much like hosting a website, you can build *REST-based web APIs* by using your choice of language and framework. You get full *Swagger support* and the ability to *package and publish your API in Azure Marketplace*. The produced apps can be consumed from any HTTP or HTTPS-based client.

==== When to use Azure Functions

If, for a large amount of time, *your application is waiting for a particular input before it performs any processing*, then, to reduce your costs, you could want to avoid having to pay for the time that your application is waiting for input. Functions (serverless computing) could be a good option in that case.

    * With serverless computing, *you pay only for the time your code runs*.
    * Scaling and performance are handled automatically. You're billed only for the exact resources you use. There's no need to even reserve capacity.

Serverless computing includes the *abstraction of servers* (no infrastructure management), an *event-driven scale*, and *micro-billing*

    * *Event-driven scale*: Serverless computing is an excellent fit for *workloads that respond to incoming events*

Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:

    * *Azure Functions*: Functions can execute code in almost any modern language.
    * *Azure Logic Apps*: Logic apps are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.
        ** For this reason, it's *ideal for a business analyst role*.

*Functions* are commonly used when you need to perform work in response to an event (often via a REST request), timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that *work can be completed quickly*, within seconds or less.

Where functions execute code, *logic apps execute workflows* that are designed to automate business scenarios and are built from predefined logic blocks.

Functions and Logic Apps can both create complex *orchestrations*, which are collections of functions or steps that are executed to accomplish a complex task.

    * with Functions, you write code to complete each step.
    * with Logic Apps, you use a GUI to define the actions and how they relate to one another.

*Functions* are normally *stateless*, but Durable Functions provide state. +
*Logic Apps* are always *stateful*.

==== When to use Windows Virtual Desktop

Windows Virtual Desktop on Azure is a *desktop and application virtualization service* that runs on the cloud. It enables your users to use a cloud-hosted version of Windows from any location. Windows Virtual Desktop *works across devices like Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Linux*.

.Windows Virtual Desktop architecture
image:azure-az900_21.png[]

Windows Virtual Desktop est une solution récente, pré-version publique annoncée en 2019/03.

User sign-in to Windows Virtual Desktop is fast because *user profiles are containerized by using FSLogix*. At sign-in, the user profile container is dynamically attached to the computing environment. The user profile is immediately available and appears in the system exactly like a native user profile.

=== Explore Azure Storage services

.Context
--
Suppose your company, Tailwind Traders, has a number of *product brochures*, *datasheets*, *product images*, and *other files* that are related to marketing, sales, and support. In the past, your company has been hosting these files on standalone web servers in your datacenter.
--

* *Azure Storage* is a service that you can use to store files, messages, tables, and other types of information.
* An *Azure Storage account* is require to store your data objects.

NOTE: Azure VMs use Azure Disk Storage to store virtual disks. However, you can't use Azure Disk Storage to store a disk outside of a virtual machine.

==== Disk storage fundamentals

*Disk Storage* provides *disks* for Azure virtual machines, and allows data to be persistently stored and accessed from an attached virtual hard disk.

==== Azure Blob storage fundamentals

*Azure Blob Storage* is an *object storage solution* for the cloud. It can store massive amounts of data, such as text or binary data. Azure Blob Storage is unstructured, meaning that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. Blob Storage can manage thousands of simultaneous uploads, massive amounts of video data, constantly growing log files, and can be reached from anywhere with an internet connection.

Blob Storage is ideal for:

    * Serving images or documents directly to a browser.
    * Storing files for distributed access.
    * Streaming video and audio.
    * Storing data for backup and restore, disaster recovery, and archiving.
    * *Storing data for analysis* by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service.
    * *Storing up to 8 TB of data for virtual machines*.

NOTE: Azure Blob Storage is your best option for storing *disaster recovery* files and *archives*.

==== Azure Files fundamentals

*Azure Files* offers fully managed *file shares* in the cloud that are accessible via the industry standard *Server Message Block (SMB)* and Network File System (preview) protocols.

Azure Files ensures the *data is encrypted at rest*, and the *SMB protocol* ensures the *data is encrypted in transit*.

==== Understanding Blob access tiers

Azure provides several *access tiers* which you can use to balance your storage costs with your access needs. +
Those last can vary depending on *frequency of access* and planned *retention period*.

    * *Hot access tier*: Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently (for example, images for your website).
    * *Cool access tier*: Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days (for example, invoices for your customers).
    * *Archive access tier*: Appropriate for data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days, with flexible latency requirements (for example, long-term backups).

{sb}

    * Only the *hot* and *cool* access tiers can be set at the *account level*. The archive access tier isn't available at the account level.
    * *Hot*, *cool*, and *archive* tiers can be set at the *blob level*, during upload or after upload.
    * Data in the cool access tier can tolerate slightly lower availability, but still requires high durability, retrieval latency, and throughput characteristics similar to hot data. For *cool data*, a slightly lower availability service-level agreement (SLA) and *higher access costs* compared to hot data are acceptable trade-offs for *lower storage costs*.
    * *Archive storage* stores data offline and offers the *lowest storage costs*, but also the *highest costs to rehydrate and access data*.

=== Explore Azure networking services

==== Azure Virtual Network fundamentals

*Azure virtual networks* (or Azure VNet) enable *Azure resources*, such as VMs, web apps, and databases, to *communicate with each other*, with users on the internet, and with your on-premises client computers.

*Virtual Network* allows you to create *multiple isolated virtual networks*. When you set up a virtual network, you define a private IP address space by using either public or private IP address ranges.

For name resolution, you can use the *name resolution service that's built in to Azure*. You also can configure the virtual network to use either an internal or an external DNS server.

*Communicate between Azure resources* can be done using one of the 2 following options:

    * Virtual networks
    * Service endpoints

*Communicate with on-premises resources* can be done using one of the 2 following mechanisms:

    * *Point-to-site virtual private networks*
        ** the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to Azure to connect that computer to the Azure virtual network.
    * *Site-to-site virtual private networks*
        ** links your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network.
        ** The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.
    * *Azure ExpressRoute*
        ** For environments where you need *greater bandwidth* and even *higher levels of security*.
        ** provides dedicated *private connectivity* to Azure that *doesn't travel over the internet*.

*Route network traffic*. +
By default, Azure routes traffic between subnets on any connected virtual networks, on-premises networks, and the internet. You also can control routing and override those settings, as follows:

    * *Route tables*: A route table allows you to define rules about how traffic should be directed. You can create custom route tables that control how packets are routed between subnets.
    * *Border Gateway Protocol*: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) works with Azure VPN gateways or ExpressRoute to propagate on-premises BGP routes to Azure virtual networks.

Azure virtual networks enable you to *filter network traffic* between subnets by using the following approaches:

    * *Network security groups*: A network security group is an Azure resource that can contain multiple inbound and outbound security rules.
    * *Network virtual appliances*: A network virtual appliance is a specialized VM that carries out a particular network function, such as running a firewall or performing wide area network (WAN) optimization.

*Connect virtual networks*

    * You can link virtual networks together by using *virtual network peering*.
    * *UDR* is *user-defined Routing* and allows network admins to control the routing tables between subnets, within a subnet as well as between VNets.

==== Azure Virtual Network settings

Settings to configure for the creation of a basic virtual network:

    * Network name
    * Address space
    * Subscription
    * Resource group
    * Location
    * Subnet
    * DDoS protection
    * Service endpoints

Once created, you can then configure:

    * Network security group
    * Route table

==== Azure VPN Gateway fundamentals

A *virtual private network (VPN)* is a type of private interconnected network. +
VPNs use an encrypted tunnel within another network. So *traffic is encrypted* while traveling over the untrusted network to prevent eavesdropping or other attacks.

A VPN gateway is a type of *virtual network gateway*. Azure VPN Gateway instances are *deployed in Azure Virtual Network instances* and enable the following connectivity:

    * Connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a site-to-site connection.
    * Connect individual devices to virtual networks through a point-to-site connection.
    * Connect virtual networks to other virtual networks through a network-to-network connection.

image::azure-az900_23.png[]

NOTE: You can deploy only 1 VPN gateway in each virtual network.

A VPN gateway can be of 2 types, the difference of which being how traffic to be encrypted is specified.

    * *policy-based*: 
        ** Policy-based VPN gateways specify statically the IP address of packets that should be encrypted through each tunnel +
        This type of device evaluates every data packet against those sets of IP addresses to choose the tunnel where that packet is going to be sent through.
    * *route-based*: 
        ** If defining which IP addresses are behind each tunnel is too cumbersome, route-based gateways can be used.
        ** With route-based gateways, IPSec tunnels are modeled as a network interface or virtual tunnel interface. IP routing (either static routes or dynamic routing protocols) decides which one of these tunnel interfaces to use when sending each packet.
        ** Can use *dynamic routing protocols*, where routing/forwarding tables direct traffic to different IPSec tunnels

NOTE: A *Basic VPN gateway* should only be used for *Dev/Test workloads*. In addition, it's unsupported to migrate from Basic to the VpnGW1/2/3/Az SKUs at a later time without having to remove the gateway and redeploy.

.Required Azure resources to deploy an operational VPN Gateway
image:azure-az900_24.png[]

===== High-availability scenarios

* *By default*, VPN gateways are deployed as 2 instances in an *active/standby configuration*, even if you only see 1 VPN gateway resource in Azure.
* But, with the introduction of *BGP routing protocol*, you can also deploy VPN gateways in an *active/active configuration*.
    ** In this case, you assign a unique public IP address to each instance.You then create separate tunnels from the on-premises device to each IP address.

.VPN gateway active/standby configuration
image:azure-az900_25.png[]

.VPN gateway active/active configuration
image:azure-az900_26.png[]

* Another high-availability option is to configure a *VPN gateway* as a *secure failover path for ExpressRoute connections*.
* In regions that support availability zones, VPN gateways and ExpressRoute gateways can be deployed in a *zone-redundant configuration*. 

==== Azure ExpressRoute fundamentals

IMPORTANT: *ExpressRoute* lets you extend your on-premises networks into the Microsoft cloud over a private connection with the help of a connectivity provider.

ExpressRoute connections *don't go over the public Internet*. +
ExpressRoute does provide private connectivity, BUT it is NOT encrypted.

image::azure-az900_27.png[]

*Dynamic routing*: ExpressRoute uses the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing protocol. BGP is used to exchange routes between on-premises networks and resources running in Azure. This protocol enables dynamic routing between your on-premises network and services running in the Microsoft cloud.

.ExpressRoute connectivity models
image::azure-az900_28.png[]

3 models available to *connect your on-premises network to the Microsoft Cloud*:

    * *Colocation at a Cloud Exchange*
        ** For example, if your datacenter is colocated at a cloud exchange such as an ISP, you can request a virtual cross-connection to the Microsoft cloud.
    * *Point-to-point Ethernet connection*
    * *Any-to-any networks*

== Azure Fundamentals part 3: Describe core solutions and management tools on Azure

=== Choose the best AI service for your needs

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a category of computing that *adapts and improves* its decision-making ability *over time based on its successes and failures*.

==== Identify the product options

There are two basic approaches to AI:

    * *deep learning* system: modeled on the neural network of the human mind, enabling it to discover, learn, and grow through experience.
    * *machine learning*: a data science technique that uses existing data to train a model, test it, and then apply the model to new data to forecast future behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

3 primary product offerings from Microsoft:

    * *Azure Machine Learning*
        ** It consists of tools and services that allow you to connect to data to train and test models to find one that will most accurately *predict a future result*. After you've run experiments to test the model, you can deploy and use it in real time via a web API endpoint.
        ** Choose Azure Machine Learning when your *data scientists* need *complete control* over the design and training of an algorithm using your *own data*.

    * *Azure Cognitive Services*
        ** provides prebuilt machine learning models that enable applications to see, hear, speak, understand, and even begin to reason. +
        You can perform *sentiment analysis* with Azure Cognitive Services. +
        You don't need special machine learning or data science knowledge to use these services.
        ** While Azure Machine Learning requires you to bring your own data and train models over that data, Azure Cognitive Services, for the most part, *provides pretrained models* so that you can bring in your live data to get predictions on.
        ** Azure Cognitive Services can be divided into the following categories: *language*, *speech*, *vision*, *decision*

    * *Azure Bot Service*
        ** Azure Bot Service  and Bot Framework  are platforms for creating virtual agents that understand and reply to questions just like a human.

==== Analyze the decision criteria

* *First, are you building a virtual agent that interfaces with humans via natural language?* +
In this case you can use:
    ** *QnA Maker*
    ** *Power Virtual Agents*, Microsoft Power Platform, Power Automate

* *Second, do you need a service that can understand the content and meaning of images, video, or audio, or that can translate text into a different language?*
    ** Use *Azure Cognitive Services* when it comes to general purpose tasks, such as performing speech to text, integrating with search, or identifying the objects in an image.

* *Third, do you need to predict user behavior or provide users with personalized recommendations in your app?*
    ** The *Azure Cognitive Services Personalizer* service watches your users' actions within an application. +
    You can use Personalizer to *predict their behavior* and provide relevant experiences as it identifies *usage patterns*.

* *Fourth, will your app predict future outcomes based on private historical data?*
    ** Choose *Azure Machine Learning* when you need to analyze data to predict future outcomes. 

* *Finally, do you need to build a model by using your own data or perform a different task than those listed above?*
    ** Use *Azure Machine Learning* for maximum flexibility.

==== Use Machine Learning for decision support systems

A practical case is given to determine which MS products would be the best for the example needs.

==== Use Cognitive Services for data analysis

Another practical use case.

==== Use Bot Service for interactive chat experiences

Again, a practical use case.

.Decision criteria to choose the good IA product
[IMPORTANT]
====
The questions to ask oneself to determine the best AI services are always the same:

    * *First, are you building a virtual agent that interfaces with humans via natural language?*
        ** If yes, Azure Bot is the best choice
    * *Second, do you need a service that can understand the content and meaning of images, video, audio, or translate text into a different language?*
        ** If yes, consider Azure Cognitive Services
    * *Third, do you need to predict user behavior or provide users with personalized recommendations?*
        ** if yes, consider Azure Cognitive Services Personalizer
    * *Finally, will you need to predict future outcomes based on private historical data?*
        ** if yes, consider Azure Machine Learning
====

=== Choose the best tools to help organizations build better solutions

Here we talk about *DevOps practices* and *develop solutions*.

==== Understand your product options

.What is DevOps?
[NOTE]
====
*DevOps* is a new approach that helps to align technical teams as they work toward common goals. To accomplish this alignment, organizations employ practices and processes that seek to *automate the ongoing development*, *maintenance*, and *deployment* of software systems. Their aim is to expedite the release of software changes, ensure the ongoing deployability of the system, and ensure that all changes meet a high quality bar.
====

Microsoft offers tools to enable *source-code management*, *continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)*, and *automating the creation of testing environments*.

* *Azure DevOps Services* +
Azure DevOps Services is a suite of services that address every stage of the *software development lifecycle*.

    ** *Azure Repos* is a *centralized source-code repository* where software development, DevOps engineering, and documentation professionals can publish their code for review and collaboration.
    ** *Azure Boards* is an *agile project management suite* that includes Kanban boards, reporting, and tracking ideas and work from high-level epics to work items and issues.
    ** *Azure Pipelines* is a *CI/CD pipeline automation tool*.
    ** *Azure Artifacts* is a *repository for hosting artifacts*, such as compiled source code, which can be fed into testing or deployment pipeline steps.
    ** *Azure Test Plans* is an *automated test tool* that can be used in a CI/CD pipeline to ensure quality before a software release.

* *GitHub* and *GitHub Actions*
    ** *GitHub Actions* enables *workflow automation with triggers for many lifecycle events*. One such example would be automating a CI/CD toolchain.

.Differences between Azure DevOps and GitHub
[NOTE]
====
* *GitHub* is a lighter-weight tool than Azure DevOps, with a focus on individual developers contributing to the open-source code.
* *Azure DevOps* is more focused on enterprise development, with heavier project-management and planning tools, and finer-grained access control.
====

* *Azure DevTest Labs*
    ** Azure DevTest Labs provides an automated means of managing the process of building, setting up, and tearing down virtual machines (VMs) *that contain builds of your software projects*.
    ** Anything you can deploy in Azure via an ARM template can be provisioned through DevTest Labs.
    ** Provisioning pre-created lab environments with their required configurations and tools already installed is a huge time saver for quality assurance professionals and developers.
        *** Suppose you need to test a new feature on an old version of an operating system. Azure DevTest Labs can set up everything automatically upon request.

==== Analyse the decision criteria

* *First, do you need to automate and manage test-lab creation?*
    ** If your aim is to automate the creation and management of a test lab environment, *Azure DevTest labs* is the only matching option.
* *Second, are you building open-source software?*
    ** *GitHub* has long been the preferred host for open-source software
* *Third, regarding source-code management and DevOps tools, what level of granularity do you need for permissions?*
    ** *GitHub* works on a *simple model of read/write permissions* to every feature. Meanwhile, *Azure DevOps* has a *much more granular set of permissions* that allow organizations to refine who is able to perform most operations across the entire toolset.
* *Fourth, regarding source-code management and DevOps tools, how sophisticated does your project management and reporting need to be?*
    ** Azure DevOps is more adapted to complex needs
* *Finally, regarding source-code management and DevOps tools, how tightly do you need to integrate with third-party tools?*
    ** No silver bullet, you have to check how those 3rd party vendors tools integrate with Azure DevOps or GitHub (through hooks, APIs, etc.)

==== Use Azure DevOps to manage the application development lifecycle

Practical use case study, to know how to choose the best DevOps solutions (based on previous questions)

==== Use GitHub to contribute to open-source software

Likewise, practical use case.

==== Use Azure DevTest Labs to manage testing environments

=== Choose the best monitoring service for visibility, insight, and outage mitigation

==== Identify your product options

* *Azure Advisor*: evaluates your Azure resources and makes recommendations to help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs.

* *Azure Monitor*: is a platform for collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and potentially taking action *based on the metric and logging data from your entire Azure and on-premises environment*. +
image:azure-az900_29.png[]

* *Azure Service Health*: provides a personalized *view of the health of the Azure services, regions, and resources* you rely on. +
The https://status.azure.com website, which displays only major issues that broadly affect Azure customers, doesn't provide the full picture. +
Service Health helps you keep an eye on several event types:
    ** *Service issues*: problems in Azure, such as outages
    ** *Planned maintenance*
    ** *Health advisories* are issues that require you to act to avoid service interruption, including service retirements and breaking changes

NOTE: Use *Azure Service Health* to set up alerts that are specific to Azure outages that affect *all Azure customers*. Use *Azure Monitor* to set up alerts for outages and other events that affect *only your specific resources*.

==== Analyze the decision criteria

* *Do you need to analyze how you're using Azure to reduce costs? Improve resilience? Harden your security?*
    ** Choose *Azure Advisor* when you're looking for an analysis of your deployed resources. Azure Advisor analyzes the configuration and usage of your resources and provides suggestions on how to optimize for reliability, security, performance, costs, and operations based on experts' best practices.

* *Do you want to monitor Azure services or your usage of Azure?*
    ** If you want to *keep tabs on Azure itself*, especially the services and regions you depend on, you want to choose *Azure Service Health*. You can view the current status of the Azure services you rely on, upcoming planned outages, and services that will be sunset. You can set up alerts that help you stay on top of incidents and upcoming downtime without having to visit the dashboard regularly. +
    However, if you want to *keep track of the performance or issues related to your specific VM or container instances, databases, your applications*, and so on, you want to visit *Azure Monitor* and create reports and notifications to help you understand how your services are performing or diagnose issues related to your Azure usage.

* *Do you want to measure custom events alongside other usage metrics?*
    ** Choose *Azure Monitor* when you want to measure custom events alongside other *collected telemetry data*. Custom events, such as those added in the source code of your software applications, could help identify and diagnose why your application is behaving a certain way.

* *Do you need to set up alerts for outages or when autoscaling is about to deploy new instances?*
    ** Here again, you would use *Azure Monitor* to set up alerts for key events that are related to your specific resources.

==== Use Azure Advisor

A practical use case to know how to choose the best Azure monitoring service.

.Use case
--
_Tailwind Traders wants to optimize its cloud spend. Also, the organization is concerned about security breaches, because it stores customer data and historical purchase data in cloud-based databases. As the organization ramps up its cloud expertise, it wants to better understand its use of the cloud, better understand best practices, and pinpoint "easy wins" where it can tighten up its cloud spend and security practices._
--

Which service should you choose?

* First, in this scenario, *does Tailwind Traders need to analyze its Azure usage for the sake of optimization?* +
    ** Yes. Tailwind Traders understands that it might be spending too much, is concerned about its security practices, and wants to have its cloud usage analyzed against industry best practices. Therefore, Azure Advisor is the perfect option for this scenario. ++
    Although you might have found the right product option, let's continue evaluating the decision criteria for this scenario.

* Second, in this scenario, *does Tailwind Traders want to monitor the health of Azure services that affect all customers or the resources that are deployed on Azure?*
    ** This scenario isn't concerned with operations. However, Azure Advisor does analyze and provide recommendations for achieving operational excellence.

* Third, in this scenario, *does Tailwind Traders want to measure custom events alongside other usage metrics?*
    ** No, measuring custom events isn't mentioned as a requirement and isn't a consideration in this scenario.

* Fourth, in this scenario, *does Tailwind Traders want to set up alerts for outages or when autoscaling is about to deploy new instances?*
    ** Again, this scenario isn't concerned with operations. However, Azure Advisor does analyze and provide recommendations for achieving operational excellence.

=== Choose the best tools for managing and configuring your Azure environment

==== Identify the product options

2 categories of management tools: 

    * *visual* tools
    * *code-based* tools, which allow *infrastructure as a code*. +
    There are also 2 approaches for infrastructure as a code:
        ** *imperative* code: imperative code details each individual step that should be performed to achieve a desired outcome
        ** *declarative* code: declarative code details only a desired outcome, and it allows an interpreter to decide how to best achieve that outcome. +
        This distinction is important because tools that are based on declarative code can provide a more robust approach to deploying dozens or hundreds of resources simultaneously and reliably.

Your product options:

    * *Azure portal*
    * *Azure mobile app*

    * *Azure PowerShell*: a shell with which developers and DevOps and IT professionals can execute commands called *cmdlets* (pronounced command-lets) +
    These commands *call the Azure Rest API* to perform every possible management task in Azure. Cmdlets can be executed independently or combined into a script file and executed together to orchestrate:
        ** The routine setup, teardown, and maintenance of a single resource or multiple connected resources.
        ** The deployment of an entire infrastructure, which might contain dozens or hundreds of resources, from *imperative code*. +
    Azure PowerShell *can be accessed in a web browser* via Azure Cloud Shell.
    
    * *Azure CLI*: nearly the same thing as Azure PowerShell BUT in *Bash*.

    * *ARM templates*: contrary to Azure PowerShell and CLI, which use imperative code, *Azure Resource Manager templates* can describe the resources you want to use in a *declarative JSON format*.
        ** The benefit is that the entire ARM template is *verified before any code is executed* to ensure that the resources will be created and connected correctly.
        ** The template then *orchestrates the creation of those resources in parallel*. That is, if you need 50 instances of the same resource, all 50 instances are created at the same time.
        ** Ultimately, the developer, DevOps professional, or IT professional *needs only to define the desired state and configuration of each resource* in the ARM template, and the template does the rest.
        ** *Templates can even execute PowerShell and Bash scripts* before or after the resource has been set up.

==== Analyze the decision criteria

* *Do you need to perform one-off management, administrative, or reporting actions?*
    ** Use either *Azure PowerShell* or the *Azure CLI* for certain operations that you perform *occasionally* (quickly obtain the IP address of a virtual machine (VM) you've deployed, reboot a VM, or scale an app).
    With them, you can keep *custom scripts* handy on your local hard drive for quick use.
    ** By contrast, *Azure Resource Manager templates* (ARM templates) express the infrastructure requirements for your application for a *repeatable deployment*. ARM templates aren't intended for one-off scenarios (even if they could do it).
    ** You could perform most, if not all, management and administrative actions via the *Azure portal*. But, for regular operations, it is more efficient to avoid visual checking and clicking, so prefer Azure Powershell or Azure CLI.
    ** The last option is the *Azure mobile app*, in case a desktop is not available, or for on-call presence (out of office) when you need to keep an eye on the health of the cloud environment.

* *Do you need a way to repeatedly set up one or more resources and ensure that all the dependencies are created in the proper order?*
    ** *ARM templates* express your application's infrastructure requirements for a *repeatable deployment*. A *validation step* ensures that all resources can be created, so that the resources are created in the *proper order* based on dependencies, in parallel, and *idempotent*.
    ** By contrast, it's entirely possible to use either PowerShell or the Azure CLI to set up all the resources for a deployment. However, there's no validation step in these tools. If a script encounters an error, the dependency resources can't be rolled back easily, deployments happen serially, and only some operations are idempotent.

* *When you're scripting, do you come from a Windows administration or Linux administration background?*
    ** If you have Windows experience, use Azure Powershell, and if you have a Linux administration background, prefer Azure CLI.

=== Choose the best Azure serverless technology for your business scenario

==== Identify the product options

You create an instance of the service, and you add your code. No infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed. +
You configure your *serverless apps* to *respond to events*. An event could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message received from another Azure service. The serverless app runs only when it's triggered by an event. +
Scaling and performance are handled automatically, and you're *billed only for the resources you use*. You don't even need to reserve resources.

*Serverless computing* is ordinarily used to *handle back-end scenarios*. In other words, serverless computing is responsible for sending message from one system to another, or processing messages that were sent from other systems. It's *not used for user-facing systems* but, rather, it works in the background.

* *Azure Functions*
    ** Azure Functions have an *atomic nature*, and can be written in many common programming languages
    ** Azure Functions *scales automatically*, and *charges accrue only when a function is triggered*
    ** An Azure function is a *stateless environment*. A function *behaves as if it's restarted every time it responds to an event*. This feature is ideal for processing incoming data. And if *state* is required, the function *can be connected to an Azure storage account*.
    ** Azure Functions can perform *orchestration* tasks by using an *extension called Durable Functions*, which allows developers to chain functions together while maintaining state.
    ** The Azure Functions solution is ideal when you're concerned only with the code that's running your service and not the underlying platform or infrastructure. You use Functions most commonly when you *need to perform work in response to an event*. You do this often via a REST request, timer, or message from another Azure service, and when that *work can be completed quickly, within seconds or less*.

* *Azure Logic Apps*
    ** Logic Apps is a *low-code/no-code development platform hosted as a cloud service*
    ** Logic Apps simplifies how you design and build scalable solutions, whether in the cloud, on-premises, or both. This solution covers app integration, data integration, system integration, enterprise application integration (EAI), and business-to-business (B2B) integration.
    ** You build an app by *linking triggers to actions with connectors*. 
        *** A *trigger* is an event, such as a timer, that causes an app to execute, a new message to be sent to a queue, or an HTTP request. 
        *** An *s* is a task or step that can execute.
        *** To build enterprise integration solutions with Azure Logic Apps, you can choose from a *growing gallery of over 200 connectors*. The gallery includes services such as Salesforce, SAP, Oracle DB, and file shares.

===== What are the differences between these services?

* You can call Azure Functions from Azure Logic Apps, and vice versa. 
* The primary difference between the two services is their intent. Azure Functions is a serverless compute service, and *Azure Logic Apps* is intended to be a *serverless orchestration service*. +
Although you can use *Azure Functions* to *orchestrate a long-running business process that involves various connections*, this was *not its primary use case* when it was designed.

{sb}

* Additionally, the two services are *priced differently*. 
    ** *Azure Functions* pricing is based on the *number of executions* and the *running time of each execution*. 
    ** *Logic Apps* pricing is based on the *number of executions* and the *type of connectors* that it utilizes.

==== Analyze the decision criteria

* *Do you need to perform an orchestration across well-known APIs?*
    ** *Azure Logic Apps* was designed with orchestration in mind, and excels at connecting a large array of disparate services via their APIs to pass and process data through many steps in a workflow.
    ** It's possible to create the same workflow by using Azure Functions, but it might take a considerable amount of time to research which APIs to call and how to call them.

* *Do you need to execute custom algorithms or perform specialized data parsing and data lookups?*
    ** With *Azure Functions*, you can use the full expressiveness of a programming language in a compact form. This lets you concisely build complex algorithms, or data lookup and parsing operations. You would be responsible for maintaining the code, handling exceptions resiliently, and so on.
    ** Although Azure Logic Apps can perform logic (loops, decisions, and so on), if you have a logic-intensive orchestration that requires a complex algorithm, implementing that algorithm might be more verbose and visually overwhelming.

* *Do you have existing automated tasks written in an imperative programming language?*
    ** It might then be easier to port your code into the body of an *Azure Functions* function app than to re-create it by using Azure Logic Apps.

* *Do you prefer a visual (declarative) workflow or writing (imperative) code?*
    ** Ultimately, your choice comes down to whether you prefer to work in a declarative environment or an imperative environment. *Developers* who have expertise in an imperative programming language might prefer to think about automation and orchestration from an *imperative mindset*. *IT professionals and business analysts* might prefer to work in a more *visual low-code/no-code (declarative) environment*.

==== Discuss why cloud services

.Cloud Computing
----
Cloud Computing  is the delivery of computing services—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, intelligence and more—over the internet (the cloud), enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
----

Cloud providers offer a wide range of services, including:

    * *Compute power* - such as Linux servers or web applications.
    * *Storage* - such as files and databases.
    * *Networking* - such as secure connections between the cloud provider and your company.
    * *Analytics* - such as visualizing telemetry and performance data.

.Computing choices for Cloud: VMs, containers or serverless
image::azure-az900_01.jpg[]

Key Cloud Concepts :

    * *High availability*. The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, depending on the service in question.

    * *Scalability*. The ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as scaling out), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as scaling up). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.

    * *Elasticity*. The ability to automatically or dynamically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it’s needed (and from the most advantageous geographic location). A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.

    * *Agility*. The ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services. +
    Cloud agility is the ability to rapidly change an IT infrastructure to adapt to the evolving needs of the business.

    * *Fault tolerance*. The ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component (or service) no longer functioning. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture, so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. This type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.

    * *Disaster recovery*. The ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly, with automation and services being readily available to use.

    * *Global reach*. The ability to reach audiences around the globe. Cloud services can have a presence in various regions across the globe, which you and your customer can access, giving you a presence in those regions even though you may not have any infrastructure in that region.

    * *Customer latency capabilities*. If customers are experiencing slowness with a particular cloud service, they are said to be experiencing some latency. Even though modern fiber optics are fast, it can still take time for services to react to customer actions if the service is not local to the customer. Cloud services have the ability to deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, which addresses any customer latency issues.

    * *Predictive cost considerations*. The ability for users to predict the costs they will incur for a particular cloud service. Costs for individual services are made available, and tools are provided to allow you to predict the costs a service will incur. You can also perform analysis based on planned growth.

    * *Technical skill requirements and considerations*. Cloud services can provide and manage hardware and software for workloads. Getting a workload up and running with cloud services demands less technical resources than having IT teams build and maintain a physical infrastructure for handling the same workload. A user can be an expert in the application they want to run without requiring skills to build and maintain the underlying hardware and software infrastructure.

    * *Increased productivity*. On-site datacenters typically require a lot of hardware setup (otherwise known as racking and stacking), software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing eliminates the need for many of these tasks. This allows IT teams to spend time focusing on achieving more important business goals.

    * *Security*. Cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technology skills that can provide better security than most organizations can otherwise achieve. The result is strengthened security, which helps to protect data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

==== Distinguish types of cloud models

3 different cloud deployment models: *Public Cloud*, *Private Cloud*, and *Hybrid Cloud*.

An example of a *hybrid cloud* usage scenario would be hosting a website in the public cloud and *linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud*. +
Hybrid cloud scenarios can be useful when organizations have some things that cannot be put in a public cloud, possibly for legal reasons. For example, you may have medical data that cannot be exposed publicly. +
Another example is one or more applications that run on old hardware that can’t be updated. In this case, you can keep the old system running locally in your private cloud and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage.

* *Private cloud* can be hosted on premise, *OR* managed by a Cloud provider.
    ** le fait qu'un private Cloud puisse être hébergé chez un Cloud provider est expliqué dans la vidéo, mais les explications texte qui suivent semblent dire le contraire... (?)
        *** je confirme que la vidéo dit bien "on premise OR managed by a Cloud provider"

Remember, the *cloud deployment model* you choose will depend on your *budget*, *security*, *scalability*, and *maintenance needs*. Azure provides all of the flexibility and capabilities to meet your specific needs.

==== Explore types of cloud services

.Shared responsibility model
____
The *shared responsibility model* ensures *cloud workloads* are *run securely* and in a well-managed way. Depending on the service you are using, the cloud provider is responsible for some aspects of the workload management, and the customer or end user is responsible for other aspects of the workload management, and in some cases, both share a responsibility.

.IaaS, PaaS and SaaS
image::azure-az900_03.png[]

Common examples of SaaS apps and software: email, calendars, office tools (such as Office 365)

[quote, 'https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/learn/modules/explore-types-cloud-services/6-compare-cloud-services']
____
IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS each contain different levels of managed services. You may easily use a combination of these types of infrastructure. You could use Microsoft 365 on your company’s computers (*SaaS*), and in Azure you could host your VMs (*IaaS*) and use Azure SQL Database (*PaaS*) to store your data. With the cloud’s flexibility, you can use any combination that provides you with the maximum result.

* Learn how to provide your own service level agreements for your apps

===== Azure Regions

*2 Data Centers en France* pour Azure, Paris et Marseille (correspond à 2 "regions", France Central and France South) +
https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/global-infrastructure/geographies/

A few examples of *regions* are West US, Canada Central, West Europe, Australia East, and Japan West. At the time of writing this, Azure is generally available in *60 regions* and available in *140 countries*.

image::azure-az900_04.svg[]

Cf site de Microsoft, _"Azure has more global regions than any other cloud provider"_

Pour info, voici https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/services/?regions=france-south,france-central,europe-north,europe-west&products=all[le lien vers la liste des produits Azure disponibles pour les régions North Europe (Dublin), West Europe (Amsterdam), France Central (Paris), France South (Marseille)].

Each *Azure region* is paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away, which together make a *region pair*.

image::azure-az900_05.png[]

Azure divides the world into *geographies* that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market typically *containing two or more regions* that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

.Data residency
[IMPORTANT]
====
Data residency refers to the physical or geographic location of an organization's data or information. *It defines the legal or regulatory requirements imposed on data* based on the country or region in which it resides and is an important consideration when planning out your application data storage.
====

.Availability Options
image:azure-az900_06.png[]

===== Availability Sets

.Availability Sets, Update domains and Fault domains
image::azure-az900_07.png[]

*Availability sets* are made up of *Update domains* (UD) and *Fault domains* (FD):

    * *Update domains*. When a maintenance event occurs (such as a performance update or critical security patch applied to the host), the update is sequenced through update domains. Sequencing updates using update domains ensures that the entire datacenter isn't unavailable during platform updates and patching. Update domains are a logical section of the datacenter, and *they are implemented with software and logic*.

    * *Fault domains*. Fault domains *provide for the physical separation of your workload* across different hardware in the datacenter. This includes power, cooling, and network hardware that supports the physical servers located in server racks. In the event the hardware that supports a server rack becomes unavailable, only that rack of servers would be affected by the outage.

===== Availability zones

*Availability zones* are physically separate locations *within an Azure region* that use availability sets to provide additional fault tolerance.

    * Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, there’s *a minimum of three separate zones* in all enabled regions.
    * Availability Zones are primarily for VMs, managed disks, load balancers, and SQL databases.

===== Resource Group

A *resource group* is a *unit of management for your resources* in Azure. You can think of your resource group as a container that allows you to aggregate and manage all the resources required for your application in a single manageable unit. This allows you to manage the application collectively over its lifecycle, rather than manage components individually. Before any resource can be provisioned, you need a resource group for it to be placed in.

image::azure-az900_08.png[]

IMPORTANT: If you *delete a resource group*, all resources contained within are also deleted.

.Consistent naming convention
[TIP] 
====
Use an *understandable naming convention*. +
An example could be `msftlearn-core-infrastructure-rg`. +
We've given some indication of what it's used for (msftlearn), the types of resources contained within (core-infrastructure), and the type of resource it is itself (rg).
====

Resource groups help to organize resources, with several possible strategies:

    * Organize based on *authorization needs*: Since resource groups are a scope of RBAC, you can organize resources by who needs to administer them
    * Organize for *resource life cycle*: Resource groups serve as the life cycle for the resources within it. If you delete a resource group, you delete all the resources in it.
    * Organize for usage in *billing reports*: placing resources in the same resource group is a way to group them for usage in billing reports

===== Azure Management Layer

*Azure Resource Manager* is a management layer in which resource groups and all the resources within it are created, configured, managed, and deleted. +
It provides a consistent management layer which allows you automate the deployment and configuration of resources using different automation and scripting tools, such as Microsoft Azure PowerShell, Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI), Azure portal, REST API, and client SDKs.

With Azure Resource Manager, you can:

    * *Deploy Application resources*: Update, manage, and delete all the resources for your solution in a single, coordinated operation.
    * *Organize resources*: Manage your infrastructure through declarative templates rather than scripts. You can view which resources are linked by a dependency, and you can apply tags to resources to categorize them for management tasks, such as billing.
    * *Control access and resources*. You can control who in your organization can perform actions on the resources. You manage permissions by defining roles, adding users or groups to the roles, and applying policies at resource group level. +
    Examples of elements you may wish to control are: enforcing naming convention on resources, limiting which types and instances of resources can be deployed, or limiting which regions can host a type of resource.

Resource Manager templates are *JSON files* that define the resources you need to deploy your solution.
